# [See with Different Eyes](http://differenteyes.netlify.com/)
Demo Day capstone project for SavvyCoders August 2018

Our eyes are wonderful and fascinating machines, able to see great distances and fine details alike, all in a vast range of color. But visible light represents an extremely narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum, despite comprising everything humans can see. But what if we could see with different eyes? What would we see if our eyes were sensitive to infrared light, or radio waves, or x-rays?

On this tour, you'll be shown images of Earth and the Milky Way with false-color images compiled by advanced telescopes, allowing you to get a better idea of what emits, reflects, and absorbs various types of radiation all around you and in the wider universe.

Education has always been very important in my life. But despite an eagerness to learn, I often had problems learning and retaining material in school. While learning from lectures and rote memorization may work well enough for some people, I learn best when the content is worded simply, is interactive in nature, and is presented in multiple different media. With that in mind, I've created a simple, interactive experience which I hope you'll find both educational and entertaining.
