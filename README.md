# [See with Different Eyes](http://differenteyes.netlify.com/)
Demo Day capstone project for SavvyCoders August 2018

Our eyes are wonderful and fascinating machines, able to see great distances and fine details alike, all in a vast range of color. But visible light represents an extremely narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum, despite comprising everything humans can see. But what if we could see with different eyes? What would we see if our eyes were sensitive to infrared light, or radio waves, or x-rays?

On this tour, you'll be shown images of Earth and the Milky Way with false-color images compiled by advanced telescopes, allowing you to get a better idea of what emits, reflects, and absorbs various types of radiation all around you and in the wider universe.

The concept of information being hidden in plain sight has always fascinated me. Did you know that while the cornea blocks UV rays, some people who have had cataract surgery are able to see narrow bands of ultraviolet? Itâ€™s described as a purple-white color best visible surrounding lightning strikes. Facts like this inspired me to look into the concept of being able to see any frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum, and the results are truly interesting.
