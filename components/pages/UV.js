    <p>While our sun constantly bombards our planet with ultraviolet radiation, we can see different effects from the varying wavelengths.</p>
	
	<p>UVA radiation represents 95% of ultraviolet waves that reach Earth's surface from the sun. Black lights emit UVA radiation, though their purple glow is the small portion of visible light emitted, not UV itself.</p>
	
	<p>UVB radiation comprises the remaining 5% of the sun's UV rays that reach Earth's surface, as this radiation is handily blocked by the ozone layer as well as clouds and other atmospheric conditions.</p>
	
	<!--<p>UVC radiation is completely absorbed by our ozone layer and does not reach the surface, causing the planet to appear featureless and opaque from this perspective.</p>-->
	
	<p>But it's not just our sun that emits UV waves; every other star does as well, so they are also visible to our newly-minted UV eyes.</p>
