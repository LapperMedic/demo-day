    <p>Gamma rays are the highest-energy radiation in the universe, and we thankfully seldom experience their effects.</p>
	
	<p>High in Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays from distant stars and galaxies cause high-energy particle interactions and emit gamma rays. This slow but unceasing process overwhelms terrestrial gamma ray detectors. Gamma rays are visible here as orange noise surrounding the Earth, with the sky displayed within.</p>
	
	<p>Supernovae, black holes, and blazars can emit gamma-ray bursts (GRB) that travel incredible distances. Though they only do so for an instant and are quite rare, a single GRB originating from within the Milky Way that crossed Earth's path could neutralize our ozone layer, sterilizing our planet in the blink of an eye.</p>
