    <p>Microwaves have significant overlap with radio waves, but the most noticeable difference is the background of space.</p>
	
	<p>Microwave signals are largely contained within your microwave oven, but they are also used to transmit internet data, television signals, and telephone communications, all via microwave sattelite. These sattelites allow us to observe extremely minor changes in ocean level and temperature, shown here centered over Europe and Africa.</p>
	
	<p>The universe at large is made plainly visible through the cosmic microwave background (CMB), radiation left over from the Big Bang that exists throughout the entire universe. The bright stripe visible is the microwave radiation emitted by our galaxy.</p>
