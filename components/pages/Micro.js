	<p>Microwave signals are largely contained within your microwave oven, but they are also used to transmit internet data, television signals, and telephone communications, all via microwave sattelite. These sattelites allow us to observe extremely minor changes in ocean level and temperature, shown here centered over Europe and Africa.</p>
