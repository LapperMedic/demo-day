	<p>While microwave ovens allow us to heat food quickly, uses for this radiation are myriad. Microwaves are used to transmit internet data, television signals, and telephone communications, all via microwave satellite. These satellites allow us to observe extremely minor changes in ocean level and temperature, shown here centered over Europe and Africa.</p>
	
	<p>The universe at large is made visible through the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">cosmic microwave background</a> (CMB), a remnant from the very young universe, prior to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombination_(cosmology)" target="_blank">recombination epoch</a>. Before this time, particles interacted with each other so frequently that space was opaque.</p>
