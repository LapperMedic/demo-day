    <p>At the low end of the EM spectrum, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave" target="_blank">radio waves</a> light up both the Earth and sky.</p>
	
	<p>Radio waves are in frequent use on Earth, from radio and television broadcast to GPS signals and satellite communication. Some radio waves are reflected by the earth's atmosphere, but many more escape in all directions, creating a sphere of radio influence that extends away from our planet for over 100 lightyears.</p>
	
    <p>But these signals are not just domestic. Shifting magnetic fields also create radio waves, causing stars, planets, and especially pulsars and black holes to emit radio waves that are visible to us from great distances.</p>
