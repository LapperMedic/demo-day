    <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" target="_blank">Infrared</a> waves exist just outside of the range we can see, but nearly everything in our lives radiates infrared waves as heat.</p>
	
	<p>The hotter an object is, the more energetic its <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation" target="_blank">thermal radiation</a> is. "Red-hot" objects have a high enough temperature that they radiate in the visible spectrum, while night vision and thermal imagery rely on infrared to see colder objects, like humans. From our perspective on high, water vapor and clouds block significant portions of infrared, allowing us to see the turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere.</p>
	
	<p>Stars shine brightly in infrared even when their visible light is obscured by gas clouds or nebulae. Infrared also allows us to see distant stars that would otherwise be lost to us due to the expansion of the universe&mdash;as a star's light is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" target="_blank">redshifted</a> beyond the visible spectrum, only infrared telescopes can detect their ancient rays.</p>
