    <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" target="_blank">Infrared</a> waves are radiation created by temperature. When we think of something as "red-hot," we are referring to the radiated heat of an object surpassing infrared into visible light.</p>
	
	<p>Everything on Earth emits some degree of infrared light, and the hotter something is, the brighter it is. Night vision and thermal imagery rely on infrared radiation to shine even when visible light doesn't. From our perspective on high, water vapor and clouds block significant portions of infrared, allowing us to see the turbulent nature of Earth's atmosphere.</p>
	
	<p>Stars, with temperatures stretching into the thousands of Kelvin, shine as brightly in infrared as they do in visible light. With the added benefit of penetrating denser areas of space, infrared allows us to see distant stars that would otherwise be lost to us.</p>
