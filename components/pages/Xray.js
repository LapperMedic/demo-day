    <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray" target="_blank">X-rays</a> are high-energy radiation, some that you won't find emitted by many sources on Earth.</p>
	
	<p>While the name brings to mind medical and security technologies, the few x-rays visible from Earth exist largely in the high-energy particles that comprise <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind" target="_blank">solar wind</a>. Solar wind that interacts with particles in our magnetosphere near the poles are visible to us as beautiful <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora" target="_blank">aurorae</a>, better known as the Northern and Southern Lights.</p>
	
	<p>In the wider universe, x-rays are emitted during violent cosmic interactions, such as supernovae, feeding <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" target="_blank">black holes</a>, and collisions between large astronomic bodies. The black scars visible in the background are due to the telescope's sensors being overwhelmed from extremely bright x-ray sources.</p>
