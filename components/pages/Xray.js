    <p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray" target="_blank">X-rays</a> are high-energy radiation, some that you won't find emitted by many sources on Earth.</p>
	
	<p>While the name brings to mind the medical and security technologies, the few x-rays visible from Earth exist largely in the high-energy particles that comprise solar wind. X-rays that manage to pass through our magnetosphere near the poles are visible to us as beautiful <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora" target="_blank">aurorae</a>, better known as the Northern and Southern Lights.</p>
	
	<p>In the wider universe, x-rays are emitted during violent cosmic interactions, such as supernovae, feeding black holes, and collisions between large astronomic bodies. The black scars visible in the background are due to the telescope's sensors being overwhelmed from extremely bright x-ray sources.</p>
