    <p>The concept of information being hidden in plain sight has always fascinated me. Did you know that while the cornea blocks UV rays, some people who have had cataract surgery are able to see narrow bands of ultraviolet? Itâ€™s described as a purple-white color best visible surrounding lightning strikes. Facts like this inspired me to look into the concept of being able to see any frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum, and the results are truly interesting.</p>
