    <p><i>See with Different Eyes</i> by Alex Lapp</p>

    <p>The concept of information being hidden in plain sight has always fascinated me. Did you know that while the cornea blocks ultraviolet rays, some people with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphakia" target="_blank">aphakia</a> are able to see narrow bands of UV? Itâ€™s described as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/may/30/medicalscience.research" target="_blank">purple-white color</a> best visible surrounding lightning strikes.
